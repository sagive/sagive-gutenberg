This plugin (Wordpress) is under constrction. Based on Ryan Welcher tutorial on a multi-block plugin i decided that... if i am ever to use the Gutenberg block editor i need better blocks

Immidate tasks:
* youtube playlist gallery plugin (url list based)
* manage to push css files into "css" folder inside build (right now 2 versions)
* better image widget with on image classes, auto alt name based on file etc.
